# Zuellig Pharma Flutter Coding Challenge
This take-home exercise is meant to test your skills, creativity, and technical understanding of Flutter and Dart. You have the freedom to design the application as you see fit, so long as the app requirements stipulated below are met. In theory, you should be spending not more than 6 hours on this exercise.

## eZCountries App üåé
Using the [Countries GraphQL API](https://studio.apollographql.com/public/countries/home?variant=current), please create a simple application that provides information on a country.

## Functional Requirements ‚úçüèº
You are free to design and develop the app as you see fit. However, the following criteria should be met:
1. An example of route navigation between two screens.
2. The full list of countries is displayed alphabetically.
3. A function to search for a country by country code (e.g., IN, SG, PH). There should be proper error handling and messages displayed if the user inputs a country code that doesn't exist (e.g., XY, FOO, BAR).
4. At least one method of filtering the countries (e.g., language).

## Technical Requirements
1. Flutter 2.5.3 (stable) and Dart 2.10
2. Proper error handling in API calls
3. Demonstration of modular programming is a plus

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Once completed, either:
2a. Provide the link to your public repository, or
2b. Send the compressed folder to us.
